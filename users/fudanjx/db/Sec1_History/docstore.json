INTRODUCTION  \n \n\u201cHistorical education achieves a number of goals at once: it trains the mind, enlarges the \nsympathies, and provides a much -needed historical perspective on some of the most \npressing problems of our time.\u201d  \n- John Tosh, The Pursuit of History , 1991  \nValue of History in the 2 1st Century  \nHistory education in Singapore seeks to develop in students an appreciation of past human \nexperiences, critical awareness of the nature of historical knowledge, and the ability to make \nconnections between the past and present.  In a world where attention is often divided \nbetween concerns over the present and the future, the relevance of History is often \nquestioned. Learning to manage the present and anticipate the future would not be possible \nwithout knowing the past .  \nHistory equips  students with knowledge and skills that enable  them  to draw connections \nbetween the past and present by understanding how the nature and impact of past \ndevelopments explain today\u2019s world. Students will gain a better understanding of why t hings \nhappened in the past  and how past events shape the present , and thus be better able to \nanticipate what might take place in the future. They  will develop a disciplined and critical \nmind and an ability to operate in a volatile, uncertain, complex and a mbiguous world.  \nHistory also plays a critical role in developing students\u2019 identities through an understanding \nof the subject  at the personal, national and international levels. The learning of history \nshould spark their curiosity and help them empathise with  the beliefs, decisions and \ndilemmas of people in the past. Through historical inquiry, students pose questions about \nthe past and the present and  draw connections between the two .  \n  ", "doc_id": "e79a94f4-83ee-40bf-9c6e-6cf79b1ec7ad", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7d7b3361d82e532cac73b7938acff477a62659a0f7750c6aadef804347db1808", "extra_info": {"page_label": "4"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1780}, "relationships": {"1": "c142648b-9762-417c-b98c-8f01a27977db"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "79bfe21a-100e-4bc3-90d7-40eb88045bd6": {"__data__": {"text": " \n \n5  Historical Concepts  \nFor students to understand how historians work and how historical knowledge is \nconstructed , it is essential that they understand historical concepts . These historical \nconcept s are chronology, evidence, accounts, causation, change and continuity, \nsignificance, empathy and diversity  (Table 1 .1). A sound grasp of these concepts not only \nhelps to broaden students\u2019 historical knowledge but also deepens their understanding of \nthe discipline.  \nTable 1 .1: Historical Concepts  \n \nChronology  \n\u2022 Chronology is the listing of dates and events in the order that they occurred.  Historians \nuse these dates and sequence of events to write their accounts of the past.  \n\u2022 Knowing the chronology of an event in history enables students to know what \nhappened (the main event), when it happened (the date/period), and in what ord er it \nhappened (the sequence or development of events). A good grasp of chronology \nenables students to understand developments and see patterns over time.  \nEvidence  \n\u2022 Evidence is used by historians to support their interpretations of or arguments about \nthe p ast. Evidence is derived from the interrogation of historical sources . \n\u2022 Understanding the way evidence is derived helps students to be discerning when \nencountering historical arguments postulated by historians. Students must question \nand assess sources in terms of their origins, nature, purpose and content to determine \nthe val ue of sources as evidence so as to verify, support or address the questions that \nhistorians put forth to investigate about that past.  \nAccounts  \n\u2022 Accounts are typically historians\u2019 reconstructions of events that happened in the past. \nThese writings answer specific questions and reflect the focus es and points of view of \ntheir authors.  \n\u2022 Understanding the nature of accounts enables students to recognise that there can be \nno single or complete account of the past.

Assessment for Learning  \nAssessment for Learning is formative in nature as it supports the learning process that helps  \nre-direct learning in ways that help students master learning goals. It ought to take place \ncontinually in the teaching and learning  of History to  ensure that students are learning .  \nAssessment for Learning is integral to the inquiry process and is to be  carried out at the \ndifferent  phases of inquiry to check  for students\u2019 understanding and mastery of knowledge \nand skills.  It could take the form of  teacher observations, questioning, quizzes, building \nportfolios as well as  performance tasks. Such varied assessments allow teachers to determine \nthe degree to which a student  is able to retain new knowledge or skill s, and  identify learning \ngaps . This inform s teachers on  future steps for their instruction .  \n \n\u2018Feedback\u2019 is an important component of Assessment for Learning. Effective feedback is \ntimely, address es specific learning gaps  and informs students on how to improve their work . \nIt help s students to develop a better awareness of their learning progress and identify steps \nto take for improvement.  Regular feedback would also enable students  to develop self -\nreflectiveness and the ability to monitor their own learning.  \n \nReferences  \n \nDoolittle, P., Hicks, D., & Ewing, T.

Assessment  \n \nPurpose  \n \nAssessment is the process of gathering and analysing  evidence about student learning and \ndevelopment for making appropriate instructional decisions and for enhancing learning. \nAssessment plays an integral role in the teaching and learning of history.  This belief coheres \nwith the Singapore Curriculum Philoso phy (SCP) which envisions that learning flourishes when \nassessment is used to address students\u2019 learning gaps and to help  students become self -\ndirected learners. It is thus essential for assessment to begin with clarity of purpose. Both \nAssessment for and of Learning facilitate meaningful learning of History and help support the \ndevelopment of students\u2019 21CC .  \n \nFormative assessment, or assessment for learning, takes place during teaching and learning \nand aims to help students improve their learning. It provides teachers with information on \nstudents\u2019 progress and valuable feedback on the effectiveness of their lessons. Teachers can \nuse the information to scaffold students\u2019 learning to ensure progression  in their learning. \nAssessment for Learning can also help students develop positive habits and skills related to \nreflection and self -directed learning through peer and self -assessment.  \n \nSummative assessment, or assessment of learning, takes place at the end of a unit or term for \nthe purpose of giving information on students\u2019 mastery of knowledge and skills, assigning \ngrades or certifying student proficiency.
