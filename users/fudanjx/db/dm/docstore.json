disease in which the sugar level in your \nblood is high. It\u2019s a lifelong condition. When you eat \nfood that contains carbohydrates, the food is broken \ndown into a simple sugar called glucose. This sugar travels in your blood to all cells in your body and is used for energy. Insulin (a hormone made by the pancreas) is \nreleased into the bloodstream and allows the sugars to \nenter your cells. Without insulin, sugar remains in the blood, causing complications or damage.\nThere are three common types of diabetes:  \ntype 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes.\nType 1 Diabetes\nWith type 1 diabetes, your body makes little or no \ninsulin. It\u2019s not always clear what causes type 1 \ndiabetes, but researchers believe autoimmunity, \ngenetics and possibly viruses play a role. People with type 1 diabetes must take insulin every day. T ype 1 diabetes usually happens in children or young adults, \nbut it may appear at any age.\nType 2 Diabetes\nWith type 2 diabetes, there are two main causes of \nhigh blood sugar. First, your body doesn\u2019t effectively \nuse the insulin it makes. This is called insulin resistance. Second, over time, your body\u2019s ability to make insulin decreases and you may not make enough insulin to \nmeet your needs. This is called insulin deficiency. Most people with diabetes have type 2. Anyone may develop diabetes but there are some factors that increase your \nrisk for developing type 2:\n\u2022  Family history of diabetes\n\u2022  Lack of physical activity\n\u2022  Being overweight\n\u2022  Being over the age of 45\u2022  History of gestational diabetes\n\u2022   Being African American, Native American, Latino, \nAsian American, Asian, Indian or Pacific Islander\nT wo things you can do to decrease insulin resistance \nand allow the body to use insulin better are eating \nhealthy and increasing physical activity. These topics will be discussed later in this booklet.\nGestational Diabetes\nGestational diabetes results from high blood sugar that develops during pregnancy. Blood sugar levels usually \nreturn to normal after the baby is born. However, having \ngestational diabetes increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.\n", "doc_id": "2eb2ceee-b033-4d23-943e-fc8379e8daa1", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "39e9b4e7e217c4c0c05c997e50c5b2115ef8a206b60aae383c4ebaa39fbda050", "extra_info": {"page_label": "3"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2161}, "relationships": {"1": "e63bbac1-64b4-4944-972d-ddbb6242d4cc"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "3defc981-2582-4c38-9575-2778df1abd39": {"__data__": {"text": "4Healthy Eating\nA key approach to controlling blood sugar (glucose) is \neating healthy foods every day. It isn\u2019t necessary to stop \neating all the foods you like. But it\u2019s important to know \nwhat you\u2019re eating and how those foods affect your blood sugar.\nOften, when people are told they have diabetes, they \ndon\u2019t know where to begin. The first step is making a meal plan. Those who have had diabetes for a while may also feel frustrated or limited in their meal choices.\nThere are three common approaches to meal planning \nthat may help you manage your blood sugar levels. \nWork with your health care team to choose the method \nthat works best for you.\n1. Plate method\n2. Counting carbohydrate servings\n3. Counting grams of carbohydrates\nWhat are carbohydrates?\n\u2022   Carbohydrates raise blood sugar levels higher and \nfaster than other foods.\n\u2022   Carbohydrates are a major energy source.\n\u2022   Carbohydrates turn into sugar in the blood. This sugar then works with your own or your injected insulin to make energy.\nExamples of carbohydrate sources are:\u2022   Grains - bread, cereal, rice, pasta, crackers, chips\n\u2022   Starchy vegetables - potatoes, corn, beans, peas, winter squash\n\u2022   Fruit and fruit juice - apples, berries, melons,  \noranges, grapes, bananas\n\u2022   Milk - cow\u2019s milk, buttermilk, yogurt\n\u2022   Sweets - cookies, candy, cakes, soda\nBy controlling the amount of carbohydrates you eat, you will help keep your blood sugar within your target range.1. Plate Method\nThis method allows you to learn portion control and \nhow to make a nutritionally \nwell-rounded plate. Start by using a nine-inch plate.\n\u00bc plate = protein\n3-4 oz. cooked skinless chicken or turkey, fish, seafood, lean beef, lean pork, tofu, eggs, cheese\n\u00bc plate = carbohydrate\nStarchy vegetable or whole grain food such as bread, pasta, rice, cereals, beans, corn, potatoes, crackers, pretzels\n\u00bd plate = non starchy vegetables: \nCarrots, green beans, lettuce, broccoli, greens, cabbage, cauliflower, tomatoes, Brussels sprouts, kale, onions, \ncucumber, beets, okra, mushrooms, peppers, turnips, \nradishes, spinach, bok choy, asparagus, artichoke hearts, eggplant, leeks, mushrooms, squash, sugar snap peas, water chestnuts\n2. Carbohydrate Servings\nCounting your servings of carbohydrate is another way to create your diabetes meal plan. Be aware that \nstarches, sugar and fiber all contain carbohydrate. \nIt is also important to note the serving size of each carbohydrate you are eating.\n3. Counting Carbohydrate Grams\n15 Grams of Carbohydrates = One Serving\nCarb Servings  \nPer MealGrams of Carbs \nPer Meal\nWomen 3-4 45-60g\nMen 4-5 60-75g\nSnacks 1 15g\nThis chart lists basic guidelines. However, a dietitian \ncan help you figure out the number of carbohydrate \nservings or grams that\u2019s right for you.\nIt\u2019s important to eat about the same amount of \ncarbohydrates at each meal. This helps the body use the sugar more efficiently and maintain steady blood sugar. Eating meals evenly spaced throughout the day \nis important to stay in your target range. Don\u2019t eat most \nof your food at one time.Sweets and desserts are carbohydrate \nchoices that don\u2019t offer the nutrition other carbohydrate sources may offer, \nand you should limit your portion sizes.\n", "doc_id": "3defc981-2582-4c38-9575-2778df1abd39", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "2cb9d7e93b45bb7338006cc2250cb2ca3a20ccc72dfe7b4afd8bd06fc369588e", "extra_info": {"page_label": "4"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3217}, "relationships": {"1": "ebb4f62d-df94-41eb-a972-1bbc3165b86d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2815678-db8b-4979-8ad6-cddd0766b876": {"__data__": {"text": "5Reading a Nutrition Facts Label\nIf you\u2019re unsure about how much carbohydrate a food \nhas, refer to the product\u2019s nutrition label. \nConsult your meal plan before you go to \nthe grocery store or out to eat.\nTips for Healthy Eating\n\u2022   Plan ahead for a meal or snack by cutting up \nvegetables the night before or making your lunch for \ntomorrow after cleaning up dinner. This may help to \navoid last-minute unhealthy choices.\n\u2022   Consult your meal plan before you go to the grocery store or out to eat. Make a list and stick to it.\n\u2022   Eat from all the food groups: grains, vegetables, fruits, protein, dairy and oils.\n\u2022   Be aware of how your meal choices affect your blood sugar. Check your blood sugar before and two hours \nafter the beginning of the meal. This will show you \nhow the foods you ate affected your blood sugar.\n\u2022   Alcohol can lower your blood sugar level too much. \nNever drink alcohol if your blood sugar is low, or on \nan empty stomach. Ask you health care team if any  \nof the medicine you take interacts with alcohol.\n\u2022   Read food labels.\n\u2022   Visit the website of restaurants for nutrition information and make your choices before going.  \nThis lets you focus on the company and not stress over the foods offered.\n\u2022   When you combine carbohydrate + protein + fat,  \nit provides longer-lasting energy.\nStart with serving size. This will tell you \nhow much food is in \none serving. If you eat more than one serving, you must \nadd up the total carbs \nto match the food you actually ate. For example, if you ate \ntwo servings or 1 1/3 \ncups, your total carbs for this meal would \nbe 74 grams. \nT otal carbohydrate \ntells you how many total carbohydrates \nare in one serving. \nThe sugars and fibers are including in this total.\n", "doc_id": "e2815678-db8b-4979-8ad6-cddd0766b876", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "df7fe66860411865e9f33ae285e61811e049de33ac2e722025e39c9a7d0d84ad", "extra_info": {"page_label": "5"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1746}, "relationships": {"1": "690b472d-3eed-45cf-a4ec-193b1b116012"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "a7618c3c-d90f-402f-81bf-3704a8cc8474": {"__data__": {"text": "6If Y ou Want T o Lose Weight\n\u2022   Meet with your dietitian to develop a meal plan  \nthat will help achieve your goals.\n\u2022   Cut calories by using smaller amounts of oils, \ndressings and butter/margarine.\n\u2022   Reduce your servings of sugar-sweetened soda, tea, sports drinks and juice.\n\u2022   Increase your activity level.\nBeing Active\nExercise, or physical activity, includes anything that gets you moving such as walking, dancing or working \nin the yard.
