To engage and support the community, I have developed bilingual personal data protection policies and manuals, processes, and standards for critical functional areas. As a crisis manager, I have discovered potential personal data leak incidents and managed them with immediate corrective actions. Additionally, I have experience in e-commerce development and management, including executing the first eCommerce launching communication and training, registering business owners/distributors onboard as merchants, and planning their expansion.
